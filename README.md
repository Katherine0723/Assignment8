Adapt the instructions of the Week 12 Activity to publish your Hennepin County tidycensus map from Assignment 6 Problem 1.3 to your GitHub Pages site using a GitHub action. You must use the "Secrets" feature to store your tidycensus API key.

NOTE: One additional step is needed to publish your report to the web. In your repository on GitHub, go to Settings > Pages, and select "GitHub Actions" from the "Source" dropdown box.
